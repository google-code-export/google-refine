#summary Google Refine Roadmap

This is a very rough outline of the future of this project.

Please be aware that none of this is carved in stone and can change any time, so check back regularly.

== 1.5==

  * Support for QA context in data loads (in progress) - dfhuynh
    * Schema skeleton must allow some links to be marked as not for loading (but just for context)
  * More documentation and testing on the standard reconciliation service stuff - dfhuynh
  * Performance - the /project page seems to be slow now

==1.5.1==

  * Issue 36: Seamless conversion of arrays into multiple columns
  * Issue 74: Saveable Templates
  * Issue 75: Saveable reconciliation mappings
  * Issue 86: Parse cells after splitting columns

==1.6==

  * Issue 84: Add a cut and paste textbox importer ? - mostly design work
  * Issue 85: Fixed width column importer - seems easy
  * Issue 87: Long running processes should serialize intermediate results ? - hard (dfhuynh)
  * Issue 92: Add Columns From Freebase dialog should support constraints - design work
  * Issue 97: Exporting CSV should allow for optional columns

==1.7==

  * Views: map, timeline, protovis charts
 
==2.0==

  * Collaborative editing support 
  * RABJ integration (allows to distribute reconciliation loads across multiple people)
  * Better machinery to guess and re-encode cell values (useful for fixing encoding issues)

  * Issue 83: JSON importer
  * Issue 84: Textbox importer
  * Issue 86: parse cell values after column split
  * Issue 88: when applying operations, try to fix common json errors, like missing or extraneous commas and missing top level brackets. This is probably important for inexperienced (aka non-programming) users.
  * Issue 97: TSV/CSV exporter should allow option on which columns to export

==Future==

  * Issue 68: "merge columns" command.
  * Issue 85: graphical manipulation of widths of fixed-width column data
  * Issue 89: ability to move columns
  * Issue 90: ability to cluster records -- to look for records that look alike and might actually be the same (useful for de-duplication)
  * Issue 91: option or preference to only show Freebase /common types in dropdowns for type and property suggestions.
  * Issue 92: extend data dialog box should support constraints
  * Issue 93: Display column groups
  * Issue 94: map facet
  * Issue 96: Data set joins - this is quite compelling but needs more architectural thinking

==Feature Requests, Bugs, Comments, Etc.==
