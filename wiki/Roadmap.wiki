==2.2==

Feature Areas

  * Importers: UI form, better format guessing, connection to GData
    * Issue 85: Fixed width column importer - UI work required
    * Issue 84: Add a cut and paste textbox importer - mostly UI work
  * Exporters: UI for picking columns, etc.
    * Issue 97: Exporting CSV should allow for optional columns
    * GData specifics: oauth, etc.
  * Internationalization
  * Streamlining traditional features
    * Issue 213: traditional find & replace
    * Issue 68: "merge columns" command.
  * More documentation and testing on the standard reconciliation service stuff - dfhuynh

Issues

  * Issue 36: Seamless conversion of arrays into multiple columns
  * Issue 75: Saveable reconciliation mappings
  * Issue 87: Long running processes should serialize intermediate results ? - hard (dfhuynh)
  * Issue 92: Add Columns From Freebase dialog should support constraints - design work
  * Issue 74: Saveable Templates (need to be re-thought)

==2.5==

Feature Areas:

  * Views: map, timeline, protovis charts

Issues

  * Better machinery to guess and re-encode cell values (useful for fixing encoding issues)
 
==3.0==

Feature Areas:

  * Collaborative editing support (really hard)
  * RABJ integration (allows to distribute reconciliation loads across multiple people) - not even sure what this means

Issues:

  * Issue 86: parse cell values after column split
  * Issue 97: TSV/CSV exporter should allow option on which columns to export

==Future==

Feature Areas:

  * Performance - the /project page seems to be slow now
  * Column groups
    * issue 93

Issues

  * Issue 85: Graphical manipulation of widths of fixed-width column data
  * Issue 90: Ability to cluster records -- to look for records that look alike and might actually be the same (useful for de-duplication)
  * Issue 91: Option or preference to only show Freebase /common types in dropdowns for type and property suggestions.
  * Issue 94: Map facet?
