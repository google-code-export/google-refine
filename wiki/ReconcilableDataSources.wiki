= Reconcilable Data Sources =

In Gridworks we currently have a [ReconciliationServiceApi].

The following are data sources that could provide useful reconciling within Gridworks.
If you would like to help with coding a reconciling extension for any, please contact our mailing list.  We would love to see some of these happen!

  * [http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice WoRMS] - World Register of Marine Species provides web service for marine taxa. 
  * [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/ Historical Newspapers] - Library of Congress' Chronicling America provides Json, RDF, XML & Linked Data with an easy to use API.
