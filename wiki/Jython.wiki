Expressions in jython must have a `return` statement, e.g.,

{{{
  return value[[1:-1]]
}}}
{{{
  return rowIndex%2
}}}
Fields have to be accessed using the bracket operator rather than the dot operator

{{{
  return cells["col1"]["value"]
}}}

Accesing the Levenshtein distance between the reconciled value and the cell value (?):

{{{
  return cell["recon"]["features"]["nameLevenshtein"]
}}}

It seems as though you can make use of a wide range of Jython structures.  To return the lower case of value (if the value is not null):

{{{
  if value is not None:
    return value.lower()
  else:
    return None
}}}
