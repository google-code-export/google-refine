You may wish a quick way to quickly backup all your projects, particularly if you are upgrading to a new version of Google Refine.  It is possible to backup each project individually by opening the project, then going to the `export` dropdown menu and selecting `export project`.  However, there is a faster way to back up all your data.

This can be done by manually *making a copy* of the Google Refine workspace directory. *Do not move* that directory, just copy.  The location of the Google Refine workspace directory varies between operating systems, and these are listed below:

  * MacOSX: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Refine/`
  * Windows: depending on the Windows version, the data is in one of these directories
    * `C:\Documents and Settings\(user id)\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Refine`
    * `C:\Users\(user id)\AppData\Roaming\Google\Refine`
    * `C:\Users\(user id)\AppData\Local\Google\Refine`
    * `C:\Users\(user id)\Google\Refine`
  * Linux: `~/.local/share/google/refine/`

You can quickly get to this directory from the Google Refine start page by clicking on the `Browse workspace directory` link at the bottom left of the page.
