"Google Refine isn’t going to solve the problem of poor data availability, but for those who manage to gain access to existing records, it can be a powerful tool for transparency."

"Google Refine 2.0 will serve an excellent back-end for data visualization services. It has been well received by the Chicago Tribune and open-government data communities. Along with Google Squared, Refine 2.0 can create a powerful research tool."

    Chinmoy Kanjilal, Techie Buzz - [http://techie-buzz.com/foss/google-refine-data-tool.html Google Refine 2.0: Power Tools for Working With Data]


Google Refine (the program formerly known as Freebase Gridworks) is described by its creators as a “power tool for working with messy data” but could very well be advertised as “remedy for eye fatigue, migraines, depression, and other symptoms of prolonged data-cleaning.”

    Dan Nguyen, ProPublica - [http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/using-google-refine-for-data-cleaning Chapter 1. Using Google Refine to Clean Messy Data]

The functionality offered by Google Refine is paramount and provides the user with a simple interface with powerful data manipulation capabilities. ... I solicited Ryan Boyles to develop a script to sanitize the data which, in total, took about 45 minutes to get the data into a proper format. Utilizing Google Refine I was able to replicate the work of his script in about 15 minutes!

"When I first saw Freebase Gridworks I was a very happy man. Here was a tool that tackled one of the biggest problems in data journalism: cleaning dirty data (and data is invariably dirty). The tool made it easy to identify variations of a single term, and clean them up, to link one set of data to another – and much more besides."

    [http://ojb.journallocal.co.uk Online Journalism Blog] post [http://ojb.journallocal.co.uk/2010/11/11/data-cleaning-tool-relaunches-freebase-gridworks-becomes-google-refine/ Data cleaning tool relaunches: Freebase Gridworks becomes Google Refine]

Google Refine bills itself as a “power tool for working with messy data,” and it does not disappoint. While not a turnkey solve-all for data integrity, it makes this tedious task far less intimidating. ... Dirty data is here to stay. But with Refine, at least it’s no longer the daunting task it once was.

=== Blog Posts ===

"Refine really shines when it is used to combine or transform data from multiple sources, so it's no surprise that it has been popular for open government and data journalism tasks.
... Best of all, Google Refine keeps a running changelog that lets you review and revert changes to your data -- so go ahead: play around."

    [http://radar.oreilly.com/julies/index.html Julie Steele] (O'Reilly Radar) - [http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/11/strata-week-keeping-it-clean.html Strata week: Keeping it clean]

"As the open data juggernaut picks up steam, a lot of folks are going to discover what some of us have known all 
along. Much of the data that’s lying around is a mess. That’s partly because nobody has ever really looked at it. 
As a new wave of visualization tools arrives, there will be more eyeballs on more data, and that’s a great thing. 
But we’ll also need to be able to lay hands on the data and clean up the messes we can begin to see. 
As we do, we’ll want to be using tools that do the kinds of things shown in the Gridworks screencasts."

"This is a tremendous contribution to the community, especially given that comparable commercial products 
are priced well out of range of small businesses, independent developers, and newsrooms. While we can’t tell 
you about any of the projects we are using it on just yet, we can say that its changing the way we look at data 
on a daily basis. We really can’t say enough about what a great application Gridworks is and about its myriad 
uses for hacker journalists and data-nerds of all stripes."

"Gridworks is a simply amazing tool for data cleansing, analysis and, as we’ve seen, transformation. It’s set to become more so for our purposes in the near future, as it comes to support the mapping of names for things to URIs using configurable reconciliation services (which might allow it to automatically map Government Department names to URIs, for example), and the creation of RDF using a more intuitive and user-friendly approach than the templates that I’ve illustrated here."
