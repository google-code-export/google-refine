As the open data juggernaut picks up steam, a lot of folks are going to discover what some of us have known all 
along. Much of the data that’s lying around is a mess. That’s partly because nobody has ever really looked at it. 
As a new wave of visualization tools arrives, there will be more eyeballs on more data, and that’s a great thing. 
But we’ll also need to be able to lay hands on the data and clean up the messes we can begin to see. 
As we do, we’ll want to be using tools that do the kinds of things shown in the Gridworks screencasts.

... PowerPivot and Gridworks. Each, on its own, is an amazing tool. But the combination makes my spidey 
sense tingle in a way I haven’t felt for a long time.

...the tool looks absolutely fantastic.

This is a tremendous contribution to the community, especially given that comparable commercial products 
are priced well out of range of small businesses, independent developers, and newsrooms. While we can’t tell 
you about any of the projects we are using it on just yet, we can say that its changing the way we look at data 
on a daily basis. We really can’t say enough about what a great application Gridworks is and about its myriad 
uses for hacker journalists and data-nerds of all stripes.

If you’re concerned with building and maintaining collections of semi-structured data, or building your 
own technology for this purpose, I suggest you check out these state-of-the-art tools.

Gridworks is a simply amazing tool for data cleansing, analysis and, as we’ve seen, transformation. It’s set to become more so for our purposes in the near future, as it comes to support the mapping of names for things to URIs using configurable reconciliation services (which might allow it to automatically map Government Department names to URIs, for example), and the creation of RDF using a more intuitive and user-friendly approach than the templates that I’ve illustrated here.

I think @thejefflarson is going to name a dog after Gridworks (speaking of his colleague Jeff Larson)

I'm done here - after google (prediction-api) and metaweb (gridworks) have been through there is nothing left to do.

@JeniT freebase gridworks proves you don't need RDF to be semantic :) used it heavily over the weekend

Gridworks looks amazing. Great UI for data cleansing, record linkage, schema mapping. We need this for #linkeddata! http://bit.ly/diAw4a

Getting over excited about using Freebase Gridworks for data cleanup, munging, and maybe, just maybe easy generation... http://ff.im/k73kf

Judging by the number of people searching for Freebase Gridworks and landing on my mini-review, it's getting some use. http://bit.ly/cvsSTh
