==Questions with Short Answers==

*Question:* Google Refine opens my browser then waits a long time trying to connect to the server at 165.135.222.96 or another address I don't recognize.

  Try to run at a specific IP: `./refine /i 127.0.0.1`. Double check your Chrome or Firefox proxy settings - In Firefox options/advanced/network/connection/settings and switch from "use system proxy settings" to "auto-detect proxy settings for this network".

*Question:* What syntax of regular expression (regex) does Google Refine support?

  The regular expression syntax is that of Java regex, not of Javascript. See [GRELRegex GREL Regular Expressions].

*Question:* When is it going to be possible to load things into the Freebase main graph, directly or indirectly?

  We're working on this. The general idea is that you first load your data onto Freebase's sandbox (which is a fully operational copy of Freebase that gets reset every week). Then some Quality Assurance (QA) analysis is done on that data to make sure it matches the quality requirements to enter Freebase. If it doesn't, you can go back, fix the data, and do another sandbox load. When the load quality passes the required threshold, you'll be able to tell our system to "replay" your last load against the main Freebase graph.

*Question:* How can I delete a whole row or several rows?*

  Follow these steps

  # Flag (or star) the row(s)
  # In the dropdown above the flag you can get a facet, by going to Facet > Facet by flag.
  # From the facet that opens select the 'true' option.
  # In the dropdown menu above the flag you can go to Edit Rows > Remove all matching rows.

*Question:* How Do I Make a Text Facet Show More Than 2000 Choices?

  From version 2.0, you can go to http://127.0.0.1:3333/preferences and set the facet limit using the preference key "ui.browsing.listFacet.limit".
