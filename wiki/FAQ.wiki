  Try to run at a specific IP: `./refine /i 127.0.0.1`. Double check your Chrome or Firefox proxy settings - In Firefox options/advanced/network/connection/settings and switch from "use system proxy settings" to "auto-detect proxy settings for this network".

  The regular expression syntax is that of Java regex, not of Javascript. See [GRELRegex GREL Regular Expressions].

*Question:* How can I delete a whole row or several rows?*

  Follow these steps

  # Flag (or star) the row(s)
  # In the dropdown above the flag you can get a facet, by going to Facet > Facet by flag.
  # From the facet that opens select the 'true' option.
  # In the dropdown menu above the flag you can go to Edit Rows > Remove all matching rows.

*Question:* How Do I Make a Text Facet Show More Than 2000 Choices?

  From version 2.0, you can go to http://127.0.0.1:3333/preferences and set the facet limit using the preference key "ui.browsing.listFacet.limit".

*Question*: can Google Refine be used as a piece of a larger ETL pipeline?

  Not right now (version 2.0) but we're open and intrigued by the possibility of using Refine in 'batch mode' if the   community finds it a useful feature to have. It's worth pointing out that not all Refine features can work unsupervised and without human interaction (clustering, for example), but some can, and for those it makes sense.
