#summary How to get started with Freebase Gridworks

Gridworks is implemented as a Java-based local web server, serving at http://localhost:3333/. You use Gridworks by interacting with it in your web browser. When you start Gridworks, it starts the web server and also opens a browser window automatically. But just like you can open several browser windows pointing to a single web site, you can open several browser windows pointing to Gridworks.

==Windows==

Once you have downloaded the `.zip` file, decompress it into a folder somewhere, and run the `.exe` file in that folder. You should see the command line window in which Gridworks runs. Pressing `Ctrl-C` in that window terminates Gridworks gracefully.

==Mac OSX==

Once you have downloaded the `.dmg` file, open it, and drag the Gridworks icon into the Applications folder (just like you would normally install Mac applications). To launch Gridworks, go to the Applications folder and double click the Gridworks app. You'll see the Gridworks app appear in your dock.

You can switch to the Gridworks app to shut it down (using its menu items even if it has no window of its own!), or to re-open a browser window pointing to its web server in case you have accidentally closed its browser window.

==Linux==

Once you have downloaded the `tar.gz` file, open a shell and type

{{{
  tar xzf gridworks.tar.gz
  cd gridworks
  ./gridworks
}}}

this will start Gridworks and open your browser to its starting page.

=Loading Data=

Gridworks can load both individual data files as well as tarred and zipped archives (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, `.tar.bz2`, `.gz`, `.bz2`). For an archive file, Gridworks detects the most common file extension in it and loads all files with that extension into a single project.

For individual files, Gridworks can handle non-delimited fixed length text files, comma-separated value (`CSV`) files, tab-separated value (`TSV`) files, or text files in which the columns are separated by some character you specify. Gridworks can also handle Excel files, `.xml` files (including `.rss` and `.atom`) and `.rdf` files.

=Troubleshooting=

See the [FAQ] to know how to run Gridworks with more memory, etc.
