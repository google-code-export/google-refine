===`and(boolean b1, boolean b2, ...)`===

Logically AND two or more booleans to yield a boolean. For example, `and(1 < 3, 1 > 0)` returns `true` because both conditions are true.

===`or(boolean b1, boolean b2, ...)`===

Logically OR two or more booleans to yield a boolean. For example, `or(1 < 3, 1 > 7)` returns `true` because at least one of the conditions (the first one) is true.

===`not(boolean b)`===

Logically NOT a boolean to yield another boolean. For example, `not(1 > 7)` returns `true` because `1 > 7` itself is false.
