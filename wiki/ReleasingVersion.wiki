#summary Releasing a new version of Refine

= Introduction =

When releasing a new version of refine, the following steps should be followed:

  # I think the first order of business is to make sure nothing has been broken in the trunk since the previous version. We need some volunteers to try out trunk/ for a few days.
  # Change the version number in [http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/source/browse/trunk/main/src/com/google/refine/RefineServlet.java#60 RefineServlet.java].
  # Compose the list of changes in the code and on the wiki.
  # Build the distributions and upload them. Tag trunk/ into tags/n.n/.
  # Update the [http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/source/browse/support/releases.js releases.js] file. 
  # Announce on the mailing list.
