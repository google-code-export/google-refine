= Introduction =

Google Refine has a sophisticated architecture for accommodating a diverse and extensible set of importable file formats and work flows. The formats range from simple CSV, TSV to fixed-width fields to line-based records to hierarchical XML and JSON. The work flows allow the user to preview and tweak many different import settings before creating the project. In some cases, such as XML and JSON, the user also has to select which elements in the data file to import. Additionally, a data file can also be an archive file (e.g., .zip) that contains many files inside; the user can select which of those files to import. Finally, extensions to Google Refine can inject functionalities into any part of this architecture.
