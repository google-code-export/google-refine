===`type(o)`===

Returns the type of `o`,  such as `undefined`, `string`, `number`, etc.

===`hasField(o, string name)`===

Returns a boolean indicating whether `o` has a field called `name`. For example,  `cell.hasField("value")` always returns `true`, as every cell has a `value` field.

===`jsonize(value)`===

Quotes a value as a JSON literal value.

===`parseJson(string s)`===

Parses `s` as JSON. `get` can then be used with `parseJson`, e.g.,

{{{
parseJson(" { 'a' : 1 } ").get("a")
}}}

returns 1.

===`cross(cell c, string projectName, string columnName)`===

Returns an array of zero or more rows in the project `projectName` for which the cells in their column `columnName` have the same content as cell `c`. (Similar to a lookup) Consider 2 projects with the following data

*My Address Book*

|| friend || address ||
|| john || 120 Main St. ||
|| mary || 50 Broadway Ave. ||
|| anne || 17 Morning Crescent ||

*Christmas Gifts*

|| gift || recipient ||
|| lamp || mary ||
|| clock || john ||

Now in the project "Christmas Gifts", we want to add a column containing the addresses of the recipients, which are in project "My Address Book". So we can invoke the command "Add column based on this column" on the "recipient" column in "Christmas Gifts" and enter this expression

{{{
  cell.cross("My Address Book", "friend").cells["address"].value[0]
}}}

When that command is applied, the result is

*Christmas Gifts*

|| gift || recipient || address ||
|| lamp || mary || 50 Broadway Ave. ||
|| clock || john || 120 Main St. ||


===`facetCount(choiceValue, string facetExpression, string columnName)`===
