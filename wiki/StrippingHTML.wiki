#summary Converting HTML markup to plain text

= Introduction =

At some point you may have a dataset where one or more of the columns contain HTML markup.  The markup tags may interfere with data extraction/cleansing, word counts, etc.

It's very easy to create a new column with the HTML tags removed using Google Refine's support for regular expressions.

_Attribution note: the regular expression below comes from [http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/25/usingregularexpressionstomatchhtml.aspx Phil Haack's blog]._


= Details =

Assume you have a column *Col1* containing HTML markup.  Click on the dropdown next to *Col1* and choose "Edit Column > Add Column Based On This Column...".  Pick a name for the new column, and use the following expression:

{{{
replace(value,/<\/?\w+((\s+\w+(\s*=\s*(?:".*?"|'.*?'|[^'">\s]+))?)+\s*|\s*)\/?>/,'')
}}}

Press OK, and you'll soon have a new column with the plain text extracted from *Col1*.
